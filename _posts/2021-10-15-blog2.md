An important step for us in looking at how to address inequalities in
access was to demonstrate quantitatively the existence and effects of
such inequalities in analytical geoscience. In particular we have
focused on exploring the extent of parachute science in analytical
geoscience. 

Parachute science refers to science conducted by researchers
from another country from that in which they are working, without local
involvement. It’s negative effects include: concentration of expertise
(or perceived expertise) away from the areas or communities which are
subject to that expertise; ignorance of or exploitation of important
local knowledge; lack of credit to local collaborators who may be
instrumental to successful field trips among other things. We focused on
parachute science as it is relatively easy to explore through
quantitative data from published and freely available sources and
therefore could be rigorously studied in the timeframe of the hackathon.

In order to do this, we turned to the [PetDB database](https://search.earthchem.org/). This is an online
open access database of igneous geochemistry data. The big advantage of
using this as the starting point for our analysis was that each sample
recorded in the database has an associated grid reference. This greatly
simplified the job of determining which country an article was about.
Determining this information directly from the title or tags of an
article would be extremely hard to automate reliably and very slow to do
manually.

## Data extraction

The data for all records in the PetDB database were scraped using a
Python script and the country of the samples determined from the grid
reference. For the purposes of our analysis we included any seafloor
samples collected within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of a country as being from country. The DOIs of the references were used to manually search the [Web
of Science database](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search), returning 1493 records with valid addresses. 

The affiliation of both the first author and of the full author list was determined
automatically using a script in the R programming language to string
match the addresses to a list of all world countries. This was followed
by several stages of semi-automated clean up to deal with mistakes and
inconsistencies in the data. At each stage during development of the
code, 50 records were randomly chosen and manually checked to assess the
accuracy of the matching and only when no problems were found was it
judged to be complete. The country for samples, 1st author and all
authors were finally standardised to a list of preferred country names
(e.g. England, UK, Scotland all became United Kingdom) to allow reliable
matching of names.

## Analysing the data

The final dataset consists of 1426 references for which the affiliation
of all authors and country could be determined. We categorised each of thee as either
**Domestic**, where the first author affiliation and country of sample
origin matched; **Foreign with local involvement**, where the affiliation of
someone other than the first author matched the country the samples were
from; or **Foreign** where none of the authors’ affiliations matched the
sample country. 

To understand if the extent to which parachuate science varies
by country, we grouped the data by country of sample origin and for each country 
calculated the parachute index, defined as the log of
the ratio of publications concerning that country which include
local researchers to those which include no local researchers ([Raja et
al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5802N)). We also summarise the
data by the country of the first author’s affiliation and calculated for
each country the proportion of foreign research and the proportion of
that foreign research which included local researchers.

## Where are the samples from?

The largest number of publications concern samples from the United
States and China (N\>100) with Russia, South Africa and Canada (N\>50)
and Japan, Italy, Ethiopia, Australia, Ecuador, Portugal and Oman all
well represented (N\>25).

Just from this graph, Ethiopia, Oman, Mexico, and Kenya jump out as
being highly represented in the form of samples but (as we will see)
little represented in the form of authorship and particularly first
authorship. This might tend to suggest issues of “parachute science”.

## Parachute index

Plotting the parachute index by country of sample origin gives us insight into the extent to which countries are subject to parachute science. Negative numbers tend to imply a greater degree of parachute science while positive numbers imply a higher degree of domestic research
(i.e. research on samples from a given country by researchers in that
country).

There are two main things clear from this plot. Firstly, notwithstanding
a few countries with high positive indices but few total publications at
the far left of the plot, the countries with positive indices (showing
high rates of local involvement) are dominated by those from Europe,
North America and Asia (pale blues and purple) as well as New Zealand
and Australia. At the other end of the spectrum on the right hand side
of the graph, countries with negative parachute indices (showing high
levels of parachute science with no local involvement) tend to be in
Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Oceania.

It is particlarly notable just how many countries do not have a single
publication with a local co-author. In several cases, including
Botswana, Tonga and the N Marianas Islands this is despite 10 or more
references in the database concering those countries.

## Stats by region

Since there are quite a few countries with a small overall number of
publications, these tendencies are perhaps more clearly shown by
summarising the parachute index data by regions and plotting the
results.

## Which countries do the most research in other countries?

It’s also useful to look at the country of the first author. Where are
the places doing the most parachute science? (rather than subject to it
as the above graphs illustrate)

First we plot a bar chart showing the total publications from each
country categorised as domestic, foreign or foreign with local
involvement:

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images-4.png)

Is is clear from this chart that foreign research makes up a significant
proportion of the publications for most of the countries with the
largest numbers of publications (\>50 publications). In particular, we
can see that domestic research makes up a tiny proportion of the total
output from the UK, France and Germany but that these countries have a
large number of 1st authored papers, second only to the USA and China.

The USA and China have a somewhat larger proportion of domestic research
and are the best represented in the dataset in terms of nubmer of first
authored publications.

To look in more detail at the breakdown of research conducted abroad
versus domestically we can plot the proportion of foreign research
calculated above by country

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images-5.png)

This plot reiterates several of the same features as the previous one. A
large proportion of the published outputs from many European countries -
including the UK, France and Germany - conduct a large proportion (\>75%
in most cases) of research abroad.

At the other end of the scale, on the left of the graph, countries with
a large proportion of research conducted domestically are more typically
in Africa, Asia or South America though Greece and Portugal also feature
at this end of the graph.

A number of countries at the right of the graph show 100% of foreign
research. Many of these however are represented by only a handful of
publications (purple colours) and may not be particularly
representative.

Lastly we can look at the proportion of foreign research which includes
local collaborators:

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images-6.png)

Of countries with a large number of publications based on foreign
research (green and yellow colours), the USA, Australia, Germany, United
Kingdom show the lowest apparent engagement with local researchers with
\<30% of publications including a local collaborator. Japan, China,
Italy, France, South Africa and Canada are only slightly better with
30-50% of publications featuring a local co-author.

A number of countries with 100% local collaboration have low number of
total foreign research publication (purple colours) as in the previous
plot and may not be representative.

On the limited data available, Mexico, Brazil, Czech Republic and Eqypt
appear to show a high rate of engagement with local collaborators during
foreign research. However, more data would be needed to establish this
was representative.

## Parachute science in analytical geoscience

Altogether these results show strong evidence that parachute science is a phenomenon in analytical geoscience. Though the patterns are not universal the data indicate that the countries undertaking such research are generally richer and include large numbers of European and North American countries. Meanwhile the countries most subject to parachute science tend to be in Central and South America, Africa, the Caribbean and small island nations in Oceania and elsewhere. Furthermore, these regions typically have fewer, or in many cases no, first authored publications despite being well-represented as the *subjects* of research. This in particular lends support to the argument that [gaps in access](https://geocolab.github.io/blog/blog3/) to analytical facilities may have a direct impact on the research productivity and careers of researchers in many countries.
