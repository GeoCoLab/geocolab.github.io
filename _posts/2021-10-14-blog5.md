In order to demonstrate the GeoCoLab concept, we created an interactive website (the "app") that serves as a simplified version of the intended final product. Once populated with a set of example facilities and institutions, the user can make an "application" to access particular analytical facilities and be instantly matched with labs that are able to meet their needs.

## Architecture

The app is currently hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com), which provides free (for small apps) hosting with minimal server configuration. For a pilot project, this is ideal, but it does mean that there are some constraints that would not usually be an issue in a full production setup.

![A brief overview of the app's structure. The Heroku main app comprises the "Frontend" (HTML/SCSS/JS/Snowpack) and the "Backend" (Python/Flask). The Heroku database add-on is a single PostgreSQL database.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/geocolab-arch.png)

The image above shows a brief overview of the app's structure on Heroku. The main process is a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) server run with [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org), pulling various static files and templates that have been transformed/built before deployment using [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev). The Flask server also has access to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database, provided by a Heroku "add-on", where the app's data are stored. The user interacts with the pages displayed by the Flask server.

## Database

As a pilot project, the database models do not cover all the attributes that will likely be covered in a production environment; they instead contain more obvious or quickly implemented data points that will help to illustrate the concept.

![A diagram showing the attributes of and relationships between database models. Models shown are User, Application, Org, Facility, Analysis, Slot, and Offer. Four association tables (org_manager, facility_manager, facility_analyses, and application_analyses) are also shown. There are also four custom Enums: access type, funding level, country code, and role.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/geocolab-db.png)

The diagram above shows the seven database models implemented in the app. These are defined using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) and migration/upgrade scripts are generated and applied using [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org).

A **User** is an account on the app, i.e. a person with a login. Each **User** can create one or more **Application** instances (e.g. for different analyses or different time periods). Each **User** can also manage multiple **Org** or **Facility** instances; an **Org** is an organisation such as a university or company, and a **Facility** is a collection of equipment or services owned by one **Org** (e.g. a lab or a department). A **User** who manages an **Org** automatically has management access to all of its **Facility** instances, but they can also manage a **Facility** directly if they do not have access to the whole **Org**.

Each **Facility** can offer a number of **Analysis** services. These analyses are predefined by GeoCoLab admins and are organised hierarchically, e.g.:

```
Imaging > Optical microscopy
        > Electron microscopy > Scanning
                              > Transmission
```

Thus a **Facility** providing the _Imaging_ **Analysis** would also provide all four of its child **Analysis** services.

An **Application** also links to a number of **Analysis** services in order to request access.

Each **Facility** has one or more **Slot** instances, each signalling availability of the facility's services. The number of associated **Slot** instances is the number of simultaneous requests that the **Facility** can handle.

When an **Facility** meets the requirements of an **Application**, an **Offer** can be created to "book" a **Slot** for a given length of time. Any subsequent searches from other applications will consider that **Slot** unavailable for that time period.

## Matching

The matching process narrows down the available facilities in three broad steps (each building on the previous step):

1. Location, access type, and funding
  - does the org allow the requested access type (e.g. can an applicant visit if desired)?
  - does the org provide the funding needed based on its location (e.g. applicant can only fund domestic travel, but Org is in another country - does the org provide international travel funding?)
2. Analyses offered
  - does the facility offer at least one of the analytical services required?
3. Open slots
  - ignoring any slots that are fully occupied during the search date range, are there any open slots for the facility?

From the results, the first available gap of the required length across all slots of each facility is found and then the facilities are presented anonymously to the applicant.

![A screenshot of the "matches" section of a submitted application page. Two facilities are offered: "Facility in United Kingdom" and "Facility in Antarctica". For each, the analyses, dates available, funding, and accepted access types are shown. Below each match is an "Accept" button.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/matches-screenshot.png)

## Further information

The code for the app is fully open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeoCoLab/geocolab).
